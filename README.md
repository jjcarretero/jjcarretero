## Hello, my name is Juan José Carretero 🖐

*I was born in 1987 and I live in Madrid (Spain)*

I am an architect and a software developer. After finishing architecture, my final career project was a parametric evolving urban area, in which I began coding a little. I became in love with programming and I decided to study a video game grade to continue increasing my skills with code and 3D modelling (which is very useful in architecture)

### Nowadays...

I had worked in software development for some time (mainly in VR and AR), I am a Unity3D teacher specialized in Videogames and I keep learning code development at 42 School in Madrid.
